# Bharat - Analyst Portfolio
## About
Passionate about leveraging data for informed decision-making, I bring a robust skill set in Excel, Python, R, SQL, and data analysis tailored for the business analytics. With a proven track record in data management and ETL processes, I excel in transforming intricate datasets into actionable insights.

My academic journey has fortified my ability to uncover meaningful patterns and trends using SQL, Python, and advanced visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. 

Beyond academia, I am committed to continuous learning and exploration of new data analysis techniques and tools, driven by the challenge of solving complex problems in the dynamic landscape of data and business analytics.

  + [Developing Models to Predict Automobile Prices](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/3-model-development.ipynb)
  + [Automobile Price Prediction Model: Evaluation and Refinement](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/4-model-evaluation-and-refinement.ipynb)

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.



### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/bharatperry/SQL_SKILL_DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/ebb29b492fea5ddf52f4cd30108d74db1fcebf34/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server

### Intercollegiate Athlethics Database
  + Created an [ERD](https://github.com/bharatperry/sql-Intercollegiate-Athletic-Database/blob/7cc3b4a2eabc422e59b4a9686b1996d0e03017e5/1-Background%20on%20Intercollegiate%20Atheltic%20Database.pdf) for a database to support the scheduling and operations of intercollegiate athletic events.
  + Utilized SQL to [create tables](https://github.com/bharatperry/sql-Intercollegiate-Athletic-Database/blob/7cc3b4a2eabc422e59b4a9686b1996d0e03017e5/3-CreateTables.sql) and to define column data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and additional constraints.
  + Queried [ad hoc requests](https://github.com/bharatperry/sql-Intercollegiate-Athletic-Database/blob/7cc3b4a2eabc422e59b4a9686b1996d0e03017e5/5-JoinStatementQueries.sql) involving multiple joins between different tables and specific clauses to filter the data.
