# Bharat - Analyst Portfolio
## About
Passionate about leveraging data for informed decision-making, I bring a robust skill set in Excel, Python, R, SQL, and data analysis tailored for the business analytics. With a proven track record in data management and ETL processes, I excel in transforming intricate datasets into actionable insights.

My academic journey, bolstered by projects in marketing and HR analytics, has fortified my ability to uncover meaningful patterns and trends using SQL, Python, and advanced visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. 

Beyond academia, I am committed to continuous learning and exploration of new data analysis techniques and tools, driven by the challenge of solving complex problems in the dynamic landscape of data and business analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Developing an Automobile Price Prediction Model

This project aims to develop machine learning models using a publicly available automobile dataset to predict accurate prices for cars based on their unique features. The project is divided into several notebooks to explore and create effective models for predicting fair prices of automobiles.

Data Methodology:

  + [Data Wrangling: Automobile Data Set](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/1-Data-Wrangling.ipynb)
  + [Exploratory Analysis on Features that Impact Automobile Prices](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/2-Exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb)
  + [Developing Models to Predict Automobile Prices](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/3-model-development.ipynb)
  + [Automobile Price Prediction Model: Evaluation and Refinement](https://github.com/bharatperry/portfolio/blob/cf7cc36df6173861681dd40426a6729d3caed8d7/4-model-evaluation-and-refinement.ipynb)

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.




### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/bharatperry/SQL_SKILL_DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/ebb29b492fea5ddf52f4cd30108d74db1fcebf34/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
